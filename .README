\*\* 5th Commit ()

    - Add script, start = parcel index.html, helps us to use "npm start" or "npm run" insted "npx parcel index.html"
    - We will use jsx insted of React.createElement because it makes code messy.
    - Functional Component
    - Composition component

\*\* 9th commit (Lecture-04, built front page with swiggy api data)

        -Learn About React.Fragment = <></>
        - Learn about props => Properties (it is object) => Object that is passed as an parameter in functional or class base component
        - Learn about Virtual DOM (Representation of actual DOM)
        - learn about Reconciliation procees (Virtual DOM helps => diff algo => Reconciliation)
        - Learn Config-Driven UI
        - made Dynamic Cards for retaurant that have data of swiggy API
        - React fiber comes with new diff algo that makes react more faster
        - <></> this is React.fragment this  is because always JSX takes oly one parent inside it so if we dont want to wrap inside a div then we use React.fragment
