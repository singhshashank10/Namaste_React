Q1* Difference b/wan

    (i) Named export=>
    -  This is one of the method to export any function or piece of code by  just writing 'export' before the name of the variabl/function that need to be exported.
    - While importing a named export, after writing 'import' we must put the name of the exported variable/function inside a curly braces & then the address of the file where it is exported.

    (ii) Default Export  =>
    - This is anathoer way of exporting any function or piece of code by writing 'export default <name>' in the  file.
    - To import we just have to write  ' import <ANY-NAME> "address of file" '
    - Unlike Named Export here, we dont have to use curly bracesto write the name of the elment.
    - We can use any name to import the default export, into the file, provided it has to be used inside the imported file with that name only.
    
    (iii) * as export =>
    - This will export the complete data of the file into an object.
