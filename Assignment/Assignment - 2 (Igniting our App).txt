Q1* What is `NPM`?
    Javascript uses different package, that helps JS developer to do their work in an easy way. So, to manage all these pakages, there must be  a package manager, here comes the role NPM, it is a default pakage manager in Node.js. It helps t install configer the Js pakages.


Q2* What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
    `Parcel/Webpack` are the BUNDLERS, use in JS & TS. Bundelers are very helpful to, it helps to make our app more faster and reduses our effort by managing the following function:-
        - Create a live Server
        - Manages port number in the live server
        - Hot Module Replacement 
        - File Watcher (by file watcher algorithm)
        - Bundeling & Minify the code
        - Dev & Production Ready  code
        - Super Fast
        - Image or Asset optimization
        - Caching while Developement
        - Compression of code and Images & videos
        - Polyfills (Compatible with older version of older Browsers)
        - Enable HTTPS on Developement
        - Consistant Hasshing algorithm
        - Tree Shaking


Q3* What is `.parcel-cache`?
   While building the app the parcel stores the data of the app in form in cache inside its space in the `.parcel-cache`. It does it, such that it will not have to render or parse the complete dom insted it have to parse only the changes inside the app.


Q4* What is `npx`?
    npx is use to execute or run any package without installing it into our app.


Q5* What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`?
    `dependencies`:- These are the dependencies which our app needs in production environment for effective functioning.

    `devDependencies`:- These are the dependencies which our app needs for developmennt purpose example:- Webpack, Babel etc.


Q6* What is Tree Shaking?
    Tree Shaking is also known as the code-elemination. It is, removing of unused codefrom the production build.

    
Q7* What is Hot Module Replacement?
    HMR  = to render the change that had made in the app (html, css, js file) as soon as the change is  saved. It only render the changed element insted of reloading the complete page.


Q8* List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your
own words.
    (i)Caching while buiding app, 
    (ii) File Watcher, 
    (iii) Minify, 
    (iv) Zero config Bundeler, 
    (v) Manages the port number of the server
    (vi) Image Optimization.

        (i)Caching while buiding app :-  While building the app the parcel stores the data of the app in form in cache inside its space in the `.parcel-cache`. This makes parcel to execute faster as it only parse the changed data, rather than parsing  the complete code. 

        (ii) File Watcher :- It watches all the file inside the app & detect the changes, this will help the Hot Module Replacement to render the change.

        (iii) Minify:- Parcel bundelled the code and minify it. that means it compress the code so that it may take less space and may execute easily and fastly. 


Q9* What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?
    '.gitignore' is the file that contains the  data of the files that has to be  ignored while uploading the projet on the git.
    We should add node_modules, .parcel-cache, dist folder inside the .gitignore file.
    We should not add package.json, package-lock.json and all the html, css, js or  component folder in the .gitignore


Q10* What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`?
    'package.json' :- It is the file that stores all the dependencies and dev-Dependencies that is used in the app. it also store details like authorName, liscence, entry point in the app etc.

    'package-lock.json' :- it is the file that stores the detailed information of the dependencies, devDependencies and their indivisual dependencies (transitive Dependencies). It also stores the exact versions of the dependencies and its dependecies (transitive Dependencies)



Q11* Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?
    Because it stores the exact info of the transitive dependencies for e.g its version, their dependecies. Modifing such an important file may cause error in running the  app.


Q12* What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
    Node Modules is a file that stores all the packages that has installed in the app through npm. All the dependecies, devDependencies & transitive dependecies are stored here. It is not a good idea to push a node_modules onn the git as it  is heavy and it can be fetched with the help of package-lock.json.


Q13* What is the `dist` folder?
    dist folder stores the minified amd compressed code of the project, when we build the app.  



Q14* What is `browserlists`
    browserlist is list of browser in which this app has to be run. Or in orther words, browserlist is the list of browser in which this app will definately runs smoothly
